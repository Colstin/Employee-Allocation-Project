# Employee Allocation Project

** Version 1.0.0 **

- This is a Simple project I made to practice using GitHub and creating a README 
- This Project takes a list of numbers, which i define as calls. I use this list to distribute the calls amongst two different groups: The early shift Employees and the Late Shift employees. I then assign each employee a call and make sure it goes in order of the postion of the employee and distribute the calls fairly depending on how many employees their are.
